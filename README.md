# PrisonerDilemmaSimulation

## Introduction
Social networks are a huge part of Game Theory. Game theory is a method of mathematical decision-making to evaluate which competitive situation is analyzed to determine the optimal course of action. The simulation of a social network using game theory showcases the macro effects of players making decisions based on their local environment. Each player's payoff depends upon the combination of their strategy relative to the other players' strategies.

The Prisoner's Dilemma Game is simulated on two networks to understand the evolution of strategies on different types of networks. One is a real-data Facebook friendship dataset, and the other is the simulated Watts-Strogatz network.
